# Proteomics database search engine with stellar performance

<img src="figures/TMT_Panel.png" width="800">

I wanted to see how far I could take a proteomics search engine in ~1000 lines of code, and spending a little more than a weekend on it. 

I was inspired by the elegant data structure discussed in the [MSFragger paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409104/), and decided to implement an (open source) version of it in Rust - with great results.

Carina has excellent performance characteristics (>2x faster and >2x less memory usage than MSFragger for narrow searches), but does not sacrifice code quality or size to do so!

- MSFragger still blows the pants off this tool on Open Searches (> 50 Da precursor_tol) ... for now!
 
## Features

- Search by fragment, filter by precursor: blazing fast performance
- Effortlessly cross-platform, effortlessly parallel
- Small and simple codebase
- Configuration by JSON files
- X!Tandem hyperscore function
- Internal q-value/FDR calculation using a target-decoy competition approach
- Percolator/mokapot compatible output
- Unsafe free

## Limitations

- Only uses MS2 files
- Only Percolator PIN output
- Only outputs 1 protein ID even if the peptide is shared by multiple proteins :)
- Probably has some calculation errors :)

# Usage 

Carina takes a single command line argument: a path to a JSON-encoded parameter file (see below). A new file (`results.json`) will be created that details input/output paths and all search parameters used for the search

Example usage: `carina tmt.json`

# Performance

To benchmark search performance versus MSFragger (closed source) and Comet (open source), I downloaded data from the paper [Benchmarking the Orbitrap Tribrid Eclipse for Next Generation
Multiplexed Proteomics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05685?goto=supporting-info).

Data repository: [PXD016766](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016766)

***Carina* has good peptide identity overlap**

Performance results: (Intel i7-12700KF + 32GB RAM)

- ~30 seconds to process 12 files, using less than 4GB of RAM
- Active scanning: ~35,000 scans/s for narrow window (can be tuned to use more ram and go 5x faster!)


### Search methods

- MS2 files generated using the [ProteoWizard MSConvert tool](http://www.proteowizard.org/download.html)
- MSFragger and Comet were configured with analogous parameters (+/- 25 ppm precursor tolerance, +/- 10 ppm fragment tolerance - or for Comet setting `fragment_bin_tol` to 0.02 Da).
- [Mokapot](https://github.com/wfondrie/mokapot) was then used to refine FDR for all search results
